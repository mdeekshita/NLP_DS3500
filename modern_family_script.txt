1 EXT. SUBURBAN AMERICAN STREET -- DAY
The camera pushes in to a SUBURBAN HOUSE.
CLAIRE (O.S.)
Kids! Breakfast!
2 INT. KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS
Claire is busy making breakfast for the family. Phil enters
in workout clothes.
CLAIRE
What's with the workout clothes?
(then)
Kids!!!
PHIL
What? I work out.
(glances toward the
camera)
Just because I don't run six miles a
day like you --
CLAIRE
Eight.
PHIL
You run eight miles a day? That's
like three-thousand miles a year.
You could have run to Hawaii.
CLAIRE
I think about that every single day.
(shouting out)
BREAKFAST!!!
Haley enters in a short skirt.
HALEY
I'm having a friend over today.
CLAIRE
Haley, you're not wearing that skirt.
HALEY
What's wrong with it?
CLAIRE
It's too short. People can tell
you're a girl, you don't have to
prove it to them.
Alex enters.
ALEX
(matter of fact)
Luke got his head stuck in the
banister again.
PHIL
I got it. Where's the baby oil?
CLAIRE
It's in our night stan--
(eyes camera)
I don't know -- find it!
3 INTERVIEW -- PHIL & CLAIRE
SUPER: "Phil & Claire"
CLAIRE
Raising kids is like building a car.
You only have so much time to make
sure the steering works and the brakes
stop and the engine is dependable
before you send it out on the road,
and if you get one little rivet wrong,
it will drive off a cliff and explode.
Awkward beat.
PHIL
We have a lot of fun.
4 EXT SOCCER FIELD -- DAY
Gloria and Jay watch as Gloria's son Manny plays in a soccer
game. Gloria paces around nervously. Jay, dressed in a
track suit, sits in a low folding chair, reading the paper.
GLORIA
Go, Manny, go! Kick it! Don't let
him -- kick it!
The opposing player trips Manny.
GLORIA (CONT'D)
He tripped him! Where's the penalty?!
JAY
Gloria, they're oh and six. Let's
take it down a notch.
An opposing player gets the ball. It's only Manny between
him and the goal.
GLORIA
(while HITTING Jay)
Get the ball, Manny! Stop him. You
can do it!
But Manny gets distracted by a PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL riding by
on a bicycle. The opposing player dribbles around Manny and
SCORES. An uptight SOCCER MOM approaches the coach, oblivious
that Gloria is Manny's mom.
SOCCER MOM
Come on, Coach, you gotta take that
kid out.
Gloria wheels on her.
GLORIA
You want to take him out?! How about
I take you out?!
Jay grabs the back of her jacket.
JAY
Honey, honey...
GLORIA
(to Soccer Mom)
Why don't you worry about your son?
He spend the first half with his
hand in his pants.
Gloria moves off, disgusted. Jay, having been through scenes
like this before, shakes his head as A SOCCER DAD approaches.
SOCCER DAD
Whoa, remind me not to mess with
your daughter.
JAY
My daughter?
(annoyed, struggles
to get up)
No, that's funny, actually, no, she's
my wife. Don't be fooled by the --
just give me a second here.
5 INTERVIEW -- JAY AND GLORIA
SUPER: "Jay and Gloria"
JAY
Gloria and I met the day my ex-wife
moved to Florida. I was feeling pretty
emotional and Gloria was one of the
bikini bartenders at the giant pool
party I threw.
GLORIA
We're very different. Jay is from
the city, he has a big business, I
come from a small village, very poor
but very, very beautiful. It is the
number one village in all of Colombia
for the... what's the word?
JAY
Murders.
GLORIA
Yes, the murders.
6 INT. AIRPLANE - DAY
Boarding passengers file down the aisle passing Mitchell,
who holds on his lap an Asian baby, Lily. As various
passengers pass they smile at the baby and wave.
PASSENGER #1
She's adorable.
MITCHELL
Thanks.
PASSENGER #2
Hi, precious.
MITCHELL
(waving Lily's hand
for her)
Hi.
(then)
We just adopted her. From Vietnam.
We're bringing her home for the first
time.
People across the aisle join in.
PASSENGER #3
She's such a little angel.
(to Lily)
I can just tell you're going to be a
daddy's girl, aren't you?
Cameron enters and plops next to Mitchell.
CAMERON
Sorry, sorry, this boy needed a
Cinnabon.
MITCHELL
(to Passenger #3)
Let's hope so.
END OF ACT ONE
ACT TWO
7 INT. STAIRWAY -- DAY
Luke has his head stuck between the railings. Phil rubs
baby oil on the railings and on Luke's head.
PHIL
Why do you keep doing this?
LUKE
I thought I could get out this time.
ALEX
(as she crosses past)
Okay, I'm just gonna say it: He
needs to be checked by a specialist.
Phil frees Luke's head.
PHIL
(to Luke)
There. Be free.
Claire and Haley enter mid-conversation.
CLAIRE
Who's coming over anyway?
HALEY
You don't know him.
CLAIRE
Him?
Claire is clearly thrown.
LUKE
Ooooh, a boy.... You gonna kiss
him?
HALEY
Shut up.
CLAIRE
(to Luke and Alex)
Okay, why don't you guys go outside
for a little bit?
ALEX
And do what?
PHIL
Fight in the sun. It'll be a nice
change.
Alex and Luke exit into the back yard.
CLAIRE
(trying to be casual)
So, who is this boy?
HALEY
His name is Dylan. I might as well
just tell him not to come because
you guys are just going to embarrass
me.
CLAIRE
Honey, it's the first time you're
having a boy over, I'm bound to be a
little surprised, but I'm not going
to embarrass you.
PHIL
I better charge the camcorder.
HALEY
Uggggghhh.
PHIL
I'm kidding. Come on. Who are you
talking to?
8 INTERVIEW -- PHIL
PHIL
I'm the cool dad. That's my thing.
I'm hip. I surf the web, I have an
iPhone, I know a lot of the dances
from "High School Musical."
9 INT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S HOUSE -- PAST
Phil demonstrates a dance from "High School Musical" as his
horrified kids look on.
PHIL
(singing)
WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER, YES WE
ARE...
10 INT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S HOUSE -- DAY
As before.
HALEY
You're not going to embarrass me?
You guys embarrass me every single
day!
CLAIRE
Honey, relax.
PHIL
Yeah, take a chill pill, biotch.
SFX: DOOR SLAM!
ALEX
Mom! Dad!
Alex appears in the doorway, holding her arm.
ALEX (CONT'D)
Luke just shot me!
Luke enters carrying an air-soft gun.
LUKE
I didn't mean to.
Annoyed, Haley crosses upstairs.
CLAIRE
(to Alex)
Are you okay?
ALEX
No, the little bitch shot me.
LUKE
They're just plastic BB's. It was
an accident.
CLAIRE
(to Phil)
What did I tell you would happen if
you bought him a gun?
PHIL
(to Luke)
What did I tell you would happen if
you shot any animal or any person?
LUKE
That you would shoot me.
PHIL
That's right! Come on. Let's go.
He starts for the backyard.
CLAIRE
Are you insane, you're going to shoot
him?! He's got a birthday party.
(MORE)
CLAIRE (CONT'D)
He can't show up with a big hideous
welt. You can shoot him later.
He'll be home at two.
ALEX
Does anyone care about my hideous
welt?
PHIL
I can't shoot him at two, I'm showing
a house then. What about three?
Claire checks her calendar.
CLAIRE
No, he's got a soccer game at three.
We've got to leave for that dinner
at five. You can shoot him at fourfifteen.
PHIL
Yeah, I guess that works for me.
CLAIRE
(writing on calendar)
Shoot Luke.
PHIL
(to Luke)
Have a good day, sport.
11 EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY
It is after the soccer game and Gloria and Manny are walking
toward their car. Jay lags slightly behind.
MANNY
I'm quitting soccer. It is a game
for children.
GLORIA
You're not quitting. You would have
stopped that goal if you were staring
at that girl again.
MANNY
She is not a girl, she's a woman.
GLORIA
Yay, will you talk to him?
Jay catches sight of the Dad from earlier.
JAY
(under his breath)
Jackass...
GLORIA
What?
JAY
Not Manny, that Jabroney over there
in the blue. He said something to
me before I didn't appreciate.
GLORIA
What he say?
JAY
It doesn't matter. Drop it.
They all get into the car.
JAY (CONT'D)
And by the way, that little blow-up
of yours with that other Mom -- why
do you always have to do stuff like
that? Could you try to remember
this is Highland Estates, not
Colombia?
GLORIA
I don't care where it is, if someone
say something about my family --
JAY
I know, the whole hot Latin thing.
I'm just saying, it's not a crime to
leave some thoughts unexpressed.
GLORIA
Like you do, you mean.
JAY
No, not like -- well yeah, like me.
Like a man. A man knows it's not
appropriate to go around showing
your emotion all the time.
MANNY
I want to tell Brenda Feldman I love
her.
JAY
Oh for Crissakes.
GLORIA
Manny, she's sixteen.
MANNY
Oh, it's okay for you to take an
older lover?
JAY
Hey, watch it.
MANNY
I want to go now, to the mall where
she works. But I need to stop at
home first to get my white silk shirt.
JAY
Okay, not to be the evil stepdad
here, but that's just not a good
idea.
MANNY
Stop the car.
Jay does, and Manny jumps out.
GLORIA
Where are you--
But he's gone.
JAY
You do realize that's a suicide
mission, right? He's 13, he's in a
new school, and if he declares his
love for a 16 year-old girl while
wearing a puffy-sleeved white shirt
we're going to be heading down to
that school Monday morning with a
bolt cutter to get him out of his
locker.
(then noticing)
Oh geez, he's picking flowers.
12 INTERVIEW -- JAY AND GLORIA
GLORIA
Manny is very passionate, like his
father. My first husband was very
handsome, but too emotional. It
seemed like all we ever do was fight
and make love, fight and make love.
One day, I'm not joking, we fell out
the window together.
JAY
Which were you doing?
(to camera)
I'm hearing this for the first time.
13 INT. GROCERY STORE -- DAY
Mitchell is shopping while he holds Lily. Cameron approaches
with some items. He places a pie into their basket.
MITCHELL
(re: pie, judgmental)
Okay...
CAMERON
What? Your family's coming over and
everyone likes pie.
MITCHELL
Oh, please, you like pie.
CAMERON
You like pie.
MITCHELL
Not as much as y-- Oh my God, you
have blueberry on your fingers.
CAMERON
What, we're buying it.
14 INTERVIEW -- CAMERON
CAMERON
Yes, Mitchell will be keeping his
dental practice and I'll be home
full-time, but that does not make me
"the wife." Sure, I gained a few
pounds while we were expecting the
baby, but that was stress.
We cut to a shot of Cam hiding in the pantry of their kitchen
ravenously eating chocolate, hoping not to get caught.
CAMERON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
It's perfectly normal. It would be
nice if he understood that.
15 INT. GROCERY STORE -- MOMENTS LATER
They are now in line at checkout.
MITCHELL
This doesn't worry you, that she
barely slept on the plane and she's
still wide awake? I didn't even
think Asian eyes opened that wide.
CAMERON
Oh stop worrying.
MITCHELL
Maybe she just can't fall asleep
unless she feels a woman's shape.
That orphanage was all women.
CAMERON
I guess that's possible.
Mitchell tries to hand Lily to Cameron.
CAMERON (CONT'D)
What the hell is that supposed to
mean?
MITCHELL
I just thought--
CAMERON
What, that I'm more womanly?
MITCHELL
Now you're sensitive about that? It
wasn't a problem on Halloween when
you just had to be Sarah Palin and I
was stuck all night in that John
McCain harness.
CAMERON
Is there a particular reason you've
been in a bitchy mood all day when
this is supposed to be the happiest
day of our lives?
MITCHELL
I have not been --
They are now at the checkout line and a few customers are
behind them including a woman in a wheelchair.
WHEELCHAIR WOMAN
(amused)
Look at that baby with those Twinkies.
Mitchell turns on her.
MITCHELL
Yeah, it's funny isn't it? Hilarious!
This baby would have grown up in a
crowded orphanage if it weren't for
us "twinkies" and I'd think someone
like you would have a little sympathy
for people who are a little different
than --
Cameron slaps him. He has noticed that Lily has grabbed a
Hostess Twinkies pack off the nearby display rack and is
squishing them.
MITCHELL (CONT'D)
What?!
Mitchell then takes in the picture of Lily with the Twinkies.
CAMERON
We'd like to pay for your cat food.
16 INT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S KITCHEN -- DAY
SFX: DOORBELL
HALEY (O.S.)
Don't answer it. I'll get it.
Claire quickly crosses to the door and answers it to find,
DYLAN, a very tall and mature seventeen-year-old boy.
CLAIRE
Hello, you must be Dylan.
DYLAN
Hey. Dylan. Yeah.
Haley rushes up and puts herself between Dylan and her mom.
HALEY
Hey. Let's go.
They head up the stairs.
CLAIRE
Hang on. How old are you, Dylan?
DYLAN
Seventeen.
CLAIRE
Oh. That's, um...
Phil enters.
CLAIRE (CONT'D)
Phil, Dylan's here and he's seventeen.
PHIL
Sweet. Let me meet this playa.
(offers fist bump)
Phil Dunphy, yo.
17 INTERVIEW -- PHIL
Phil stares intently into the camera saying nothing. Then:
PHIL
It's like that. You just let the
eyes do the work. Your mouth might
be saying, "Hey, we cool", but your
eyes are saying, "I know what you're
here for, and that shiznit is broke."
18 INT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S HOUSE -- DAY
Phil is at the bottom of the stairs as Dylan crosses back
down to shake hands. Phil starts to put on his "intimidating"
face, but as Dylan reaches the ground floor Phil sees that
Dylan is several inches taller than he is.
DYLAN
Hey, what's up?
PHIL
Nu-in, nu-in much.
HALEY
(hating this)
Okay.
Never losing eye contact, Phil steps up the first step of
the stairs so that now he's a little taller than Dylan.
PHIL
So you two have fun today, just make
sure you keep it real, know what I mean?
DYLAN
(looks to Haley)
Uh..
HALEY
Dad!
PHIL
That's cool. That's--
To be even more intimidating, Phil steps up another step but
loses his grip on the banister when it slips in some baby
oil left over from freeing Luke. He awkwardly saves himself,
but wrenches his back in the process.
PHIL (CONT'D)
Oh boy. Ohhhh. That's not good.
CLAIRE
Honey?
DYLAN
You okay?
PHIL
Yeah, I'm ---
(MORE)
PHIL (CONT'D)
(unable to stand)
-- no I'm not.
19 INT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
Dylan carries Phil to the couch, holding him like a baby.
CLAIRE
Should I call the doctor?
PHIL
No.
(to Dylan)
You're very strong, Homes.
Haley is horrified.
END OF ACT TWO
ACT THREE
20 INT. MALL - DAY
Jay, Gloria, and Manny are walking through the mall. Jay is
still in his track suit. Manny now wears his puffy, white
shirt. Manny spots Brenda Feldman, the cute 16 year-old we
saw on her bike earlier, at work in Wetzel's Pretzels.
MANNY
(reverently)
Brenda Feldman.
JAY
I can't watch this.
A saleswoman passes, promoting cologne.
SALESWOMAN
Panache for Men?
JAY
(a little annoyed)
No.
MANNY
I will take some.
(as she spritzes him)
Thank you. And that is a lovely
color on you.
SALESWOMAN
Well, aren't you a gentleman?
MANNY
Yes.
The saleswoman moves off as Manny pulls some folded sheets
out of his pocket.
GLORIA
What is that?
MANNY
A poem I have written for Brenda.
JAY
Of course it is.
Gloria shoots Jay a steely look.
MANNY
I put my thoughts into words, and
now my words into action.
Manny crosses over to Wetzel's Pretzels. Jay and Gloria
watch him go. It's clear Gloria is giving Jay a cold
shoulder.
JAY
I'll give him one thing, he's got
some cahoneys.
GLORIA
Please, don't do a torture on my
language.
She turns away from him.
JAY
Look, I know you're upset cause I
got a little mad in the car. You
want to talk about that?
GLORIA
I'm trying to have an unexpressed
emotion.
JAY
So you're just going to stay mad?
GLORIA
I'll just say this: You could learn
from Manny. He doesn't keep how he
feels inside, and it may not work
out for him over there today but it
will someday. He's not afraid of
how he feels, and women like that.
(admiring him)
He's like a bullfighter.
JAY
(struggling with this
a little)
Okay, I think I got mad in the car
because I was bugged about what that
guy said to me at the game. He
thought I was your Dad. And that's
not the first time that's happened,
people... thinking I'm too old for
you.
He looks to Manny. He's reciting his poem now, Brenda holding
the flowers Manny has brought. It inspires Jay to go on.
JAY (CONT'D)
And I guess I'm worried maybe you'll
think that too some day.
GLORIA
(melted by his honesty)
How can you think that? I would
never! How could I when you're so
cute?
She hugs and kisses him -- the public affection is a little
too much for Jay.
JAY
Okay, that's enough of that.
GLORIA
And if it bothers you and you want
to look a little younger, we can get
you some hipper clothes. There's a
store right there that--
JAY
Let's not go crazy. I'll be fine.
Manny rejoins them.
MANNY
She has a boyfriend.
GLORIA
I'm sorry, Niño.
She hugs him.
MANNY
I gave her my heart and she gave me
a pretzel dog.
(then)
That was pretty stupid of me, wasn't
it?
JAY
You know what, Manny, no it wasn't
stupid. It was fantastic. You took
a big swing and I respect the hell
out of that. C'mon, let's go get
some lunch. Anywhere you want to
go.
They start off, Jay striding briskly. Gloria gives Manny a
big hug, which causes them to linger behind a bit. After a
short distance, Jay is stopped by a security guard.
SECURITY GUARD
Excuse me, sir, we ask that all mallwalkers stay to the right.
JAY
What?
He sees that he is being approached by a large group of senior
citizen mall walkers. Many of the men are dressed similarly
to Jay. They pass him.
SECURITY GUARD
Thank you sir.
The security guard heads off.
JAY
(to Gloria)
I'll meet up with you guys.
Jay turns and heads into the funky clothes store as Gloria
and Manny continue on their way.
21 INT. MITCHELL & CAMERON'S CONDO -- DAY
The front door opens and Mitchell and Cameron enter, carrying
Lily, their luggage and the groceries. There is an antique
'60s robot in one corner.
CAMERON
Tada! Your new home! Isn't it
gorgeous, except for that robot -- I
hate to break it to you, your other
daddy is a big nerd.
They exit into Lily's room.
22 INT. LILY'S ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
They enter, and Cameron looks up at the ceiling. On it a
mural has been painted. It is a heavenly scene, full of
clouds. Emerging from one cloud are Cameron and Mitchell
painted like angels with wings.
CAMERON
(gasping)
Oh my God, do you love it?
MITCHELL
What the hell is it?
CAMERON
I had Andre do it while we were gone.
Look, that's us.
MITCHELL
Yeah, I see. With wings.
CAMERON
We're floating above her, always
there to protect her.
MITCHELL
Like fairies, you mean. Okay, now I
get it. "Yes, we pulled you out of
your home in Vietnam, but don't worry,
things will be perfectly normal here.
Your dads are floating fairies." You
know, I really don't need my family
ridiculing me over this tonight.
Call Andre and have him paint
something... less gay.
CAMERON
That is not that gay.
MITCHELL
A triptych of us having sex would be
less gay.
CAMERON
You know what? I've put up with
this mood of yours all day. What is
your deal?
MITCHELL
Nothing.
CAMERON
See when he looks at the floor, Lily?
That's what nerdy daddy does when
he's lying.
MITCHELL
I never told them, all right?
CAMERON
What?
MITCHELL
I never told my family we were
adopting a baby.
CAMERON
Are you kidding me? Why the hell
not?
MITCHELL
We weren't telling anyone until we
knew it was official and then when
the agency called last week I had
to, you know, pack and --
CAMERON
We left two days later and I packed
for you! You wussed out!
MITCHELL
Okay fine, my family was going to
have a big opinion and I just didn't
want to hear it.
CAMERON
But it's the ceiling's that's too
gay.
Mitchell storms off.
23 INT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S KITCHEN -- DAY
Claire is at the foot of the stairs.
HALEY (O.S.)
Alex, get out! Mom!
CLAIRE
(calling up)
Alex, leave your sister alone.
Alex enters.
ALEX
I was just getting my sweatshirt.
CLAIRE
You need to respect their privacy.
(then)
What are they doing up there?
ALEX
Nothing. Lying on her bed watching
a movie.
CLAIRE
(trying to be okay
with this)
Oh. Oh. Well, good. So, I'm making
a cake for tonight, want to help me?
ALEX
Can I do the frosting?
CLAIRE
Sure, sweetie.
Claire begins to tie an apron around Alex.
CLAIRE (CONT'D)
Wow, I remember when you used to
trip over this thing.
They smile at that memory, maybe Claire rubs noses with her.
ALEX
So, if Haley got pregnant, would you
ever do one of those weird things
where you pretend she has mono for a
few months and then tell everyone
the baby is yours?
CLAIRE
What?
ALEX
This senior at school was "out sick"
for like four months, but Robby
Richman swears he saw her
breastfeeding at a California Chicken
Cafe.
24 EXT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S BACK YARD -- DAY
Phil holds the gun.
PHIL
What are you wearing?
Reveal Luke wearing three shirts, a big jacket and two hats.
LUKE
Nothing.
PHIL
Uh-uh. Jacket off. One shirt, one
hat. No pain, no gain. Jesus, how
many pairs of underwear do you have on?
LUKE
One.
(then)
Six.
25 INT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS -- DAY
Claire and Alex are as before. Claire is looking pretty
horrified.
ALEX
First of all, it would be really cool
to see Haley that fat. And how awesome
would it be to have a secret little
brother who's really my nephew.
CLAIRE
Alex, Haley is not getting pregnant.
ALEX
I'm just saying if.
CLAIRE
(trying to hide her
panic)
But there's no point in saying if.
If is what you say when things can
happen and this can't happen.
(then)
I can't believe I have to prove this
to you.
She rushes out.
26 EXT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S BACK YARD - DAY
Luke is down to one layer of clothes. Phil has the gun.
PHIL
I want you to know, I'm not enjoying
this. But it's an important lesson
you're learning.
He begins to pace off steps away from the nervous Luke.
27 INT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S HOUSE -DAY -- CONTINUOUS
Claire walks up the stairs, matching Phil's pace.
28 EXT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S BACK YARD - DAY -- CONTINUOUS
Phil is finishing his paces, then turns.
LUKE
You're too close. It's going to
hurt.
PHIL
It's supposed to.
LUKE
Why are you smiling?
29 INT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S HOUSE -DAY -- CONTINUOUS
Claire has reached Haley's closed door. She's about to burst
in, when she stops and retreats.
30 EXT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S BACK YARD - DAY -- CONTINUOUS
Phil has the gun trained on Luke, then:
PHIL
Oh, forget it. I can't do this.
The point is you're scared, and I
think you've learned your lesson
just by --
BANG! The gun fires, and Luke yelps.
PHIL (CONT'D)
Wow.
31 INT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
Claire barrels through Haley's door to find:
32 INT. HALEY'S ROOM - DAY -- CONTINUOUS
Haley and Dylan are on her bed, watching a movie on her
laptop. They both have Starbucks.
HALEY
(mortified)
Mom! What are you doing?
CLAIRE
What am I doing? Seeing if you guys
need anything, okay?
HALEY
You could knock.
CLAIRE
Knock? You knock when you think
people are doing something private,
which you aren't, obviously, why
would you be? Although I think we
all read that study this week saying
thirty-nine-percent of sixteen-yearolds have had sexual intercourse.
And as long as we're talking, what
is with the coffee all the time?
Huh? Whatever happened to ice cream?
And all the texting and your cell
phones glued to your hands, like
you're little business-people.
Doesn't anyone want to run around
and ride bikes and be kids anymore?
They look at her stunned.
CLAIRE (CONT'D)
So did you guys need anything?
33 EXT. PHIL & CLAIRE'S BACK YARD -- DAY
Phil is tending to Luke's injury, still holding the gun.
LUKE
You hit my bone!
PHIL
It was an accident!
Haley comes out.
HALEY
Dad, you have got to talk to Mom!
She is like completely freaking out
and embarrassing me!
PHIL
Well honey, your Mom isn't always as
cool about things as I am --
Dylan steps outside, joining Haley, and Phil accidentally
fires the gun again, hitting him.
DYLAN
Owww!
He falls to the ground.
PHIL
What is with this thing?
HALEY
Oh. My. God.
END OF ACT THREE
ACT FOUR
34 INTERVIEW -- MITCHELL & CAMERON (THEIR CONDO)
They sit waiting for Mitchell's family. Cameron holds Lily.
MITCHELL
I've got good reason to be nervous.
I'm having flashbacks to when I told
my family I was gay. My mom cried
for a week and my Dad still does
this thing where he announces himself
before walking into any room we're
in to make sure he doesn't see
anything.
CAMERON
My parents always knew. My mother
says she was in labor with me for
twenty-nine hours because I came out
of the womb like this:
He does a big wide-armed flourish.
SFX: DOORBELL
MITCHELL
Uggghhhh. I don't know if I can do
this.
CAMERON
I'm giving you three minutes and
then I'm bringing her out.
Cameron retreats for Lily's room. Mitchell opens the door
to reveal Claire, Phil and the kids.
CLAIRE
Hey!
MITCHELL
Hey guys!
She hands him a bottle of wine.
MITCHELL (CONT'D)
Oh, thanks.
CLAIRE
Don't thank me, just open it. Dad
was parking right behind us.
JAY
Knock, knock!
True to form, Jay both KNOCKS and RINGS THE DOORBELL.
JAY (CONT'D)
No kissing! We're here.
Jay enters with Gloria and Manny. Jay wears ripped jeans, a
garish, very colorful jacket and jeweled Ed Hardy hat. Manny
wears his white satin shirt.
MITCHELL
Don't worry, Dad, nothing gay going
on in here. May I take your multicolored coat and jeweled cap?
They all ad-lib greetings.
GLORIA
(to Mitchell)
So how was your trip?
MITCHELL
Oh, it was great. But about that, I
actually have something I need to
tell you guys...
ANGLE ON CAM
He's just around the corner, holding Lily, waiting for his
cue to enter.
MITCHELL (CONT'D)
We didn't just go there for
pleasure... We kind of have some big
news.
JAY
Oh god. If Cam walks out here with
boobs, I'm leaving.
CLAIRE
Dad!
HALEY
I hope he didn't embarrass you, Mom.
She moves off, with attitude.
CLAIRE
That's nothing. She had her first
boy over today, I lost it in front
of them and then Phil shot him.
ANGLE ON CAM
Getting impatient, waiting for his cue.
MITCHELL
So anyway... about a year ago, Cam
and I started feeling this longing
for something... more.
Haley has joined Manny.
MANNY
Hello, Haley. You look especially
beautiful tonight.
GLORIA
Manny! Give it a rest.
MITCHELL
Anyway --
PHIL
(having noticed her
outfit)
Wow, that's a beautiful skirt, Gloria.
GLORIA
Oh, thank you. It's suede, Pheel.
He feels her skirt.
PHIL
(hearing "feel")
Ooh, it's --
Claire slaps his hand away.
CLAIRE
Phil! That's how she says "Phil".
The lights dim.
JAY
What the hell's going on?
MUSIC CUE: LION KING "CIRCLE OF LIFE"
Everybody turns. Cameron enters holding Lily. In time to
the music, he dramatically raises her toward the heavens.
They all look at one another, mystified.
MITCHELL
We adopted a baby.
CLAIRE
What?!
MITCHELL
That's why we went to Vietnam. Her
name is Lily.
GLORIA
Oh my god, look at the little angel!
CLAIRE
She's yours?!
MITCHELL
I know. I can't believe it either.
PHIL
Hi, Lily.
(TO MITCHELL & CAM)
Isn't that going to be tough for her
to say?
HALEY
She's so cute.
ALEX
(to Haley)
You could totally have one, you know.
Cameron brings Lily over to Jay.
MITCHELL
So... what do you think, grandpa?
Everybody turns to see Jay's reaction.
JAY
I gotta admit I never thought I'd
get a baby out of you two.
(he takes Lily)
You're a cute little fortune cookie,
aren't ya?
(then)
Okay. That's wet. Someone take
him.
MITCHELL
Her, Dad. I'll change her.
CLAIRE
Let me help.
35 INT. LILY'S ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
Mitchell and Claire enter and begin changing Lily's diaper.
CLAIRE
How could you not say something?
MITCHELL
I don't know. Maybe I thought you'd
try to talk me out of it.
CLAIRE
I love how you see me as some huge
busybody.
(pushes him aside,
takes over changing
the diaper)
I mean, yes, it's a huge
responsibility, it's gonna put a lot
of pressure on you two that you might
not be able to handle. What did Mom
say?
MITCHELL
I haven't told her yet, but that was
a good sneak preview.
CLAIRE
(re: Lily)
So what do you know about her parents?
MITCHELL
Not much. I just know her mother
was sixteen.
CLAIRE
Oh, God. Well, she's gorgeous.
MITCHELL
Thanks. I just hope...
CLAIRE
What?
MITCHELL
I already love her so much and...
it's hard enough for any kid, let
alone one with two dads. What if,
when she gets older, she's ashamed
of us?
She hugs him.
CLAIRE
Oh honey, don't be ridiculous. You're
her parents. Of course she'll be
ashamed of you.
(then)
My kids are mortified by me. Which
is pretty ironic considering Haley
dresses like a hooker, Alex dresses
like a lesbian and...
36 INT. LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
The whole family is now gathered around a baby monitor on a
table.
CLAIRE
...Luke can barely get his shoes on
the right feet. And tell me you're
not horrified by Dad and that Huggy
Bear outfit that Charo out there
bought for him.
37 INT. LILY'S ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
CLAIRE
The point is, Lily is the luckiest
little girl in the world, getting
you two. So stop worrying.
MITCHELL
All right.
CLAIRE
Come on, we're all together. Let's
go out there and enjoy this.
They head back out to the living room.
38 INT. LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
As they enter, everybody stares at them unhappily.
MITCHELL
What?
FADE TO BLACK.
